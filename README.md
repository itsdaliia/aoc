## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual set of programming puzzles created and run by **Eric Wastl**. It works like a digital Advent calendar, releasing a new puzzle every day from **December 1st to 12th**. Each day has **two parts** — you must solve the first to unlock the second — and you can solve them in **any programming language**.

The event is **100% free** and suitable for all skill levels. You can discuss puzzles and solutions on the [r/adventofcode subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) or join the **#adventofcode IRC channel** on irc.libera.chat.

If you enjoy it, you can support Eric by **[donating here](https://adventofcode.com/support)**.
